      "If you are attracted to the sea, you can see its actions right from Taellelyset’s living room or out on the beach--shorebirds pecking at waves or running along the shoreline, seashells and seagrasses rolling with the waves, salt sprays in the air, wrinkles of the wind-stressed sea. Many marshes here are bird sanctuaries, please look up Foul Weather Bluff Preserve Trail maintained by Nature Conservancy. It is truly magical. If you love forests, mountains, Hansville’s Greenway is right around the corner; it has an extensive trail system for you to enjoy; the nearby historic Port Gamble also has old logging roads tucked away among hills, now open for public use. Then, Olympic National Park is a 1.5-hour drive away, where you can hike in solitude, and admire beautiful trees, or be charmed by the wild Pacific Ocean. Or, if you prefer crowds, games, food, and groovy music, the nearby The Point Casino (around seven minutes away by car) offers them all.\n",

      "Ballard is a destination point in Seattle, with a walk ability rating of 90%.  You can walk to well over 75  local restaurants, plus a large number of fun local shops, or spend the day at Golden Gardens, a beach area (20-25 minute walk).  The Hiram Locks are only 3 blocks away from my home and a bus ride gets you into downtown Seattle or the Space Needle in 25 minutes.  There are local bike rental places, and access to bike trails that takes you up north around Lake Washington.  Another bike trail takes you right onto the Seattle waterfront and our famous Pike’s Street Market.  Ballard even has its own beautifully restored movie theater, plus lots of other local attractions.  My home is a mere block from the water.\n",

For those looking to shop, Westlake Center Mall and the Pacific Place Mall are in close proximity. On a shoestring budget? No worries! Seattle is renowned for its thrift-shops and you can secure some awesome and unique clothing for next-to-nothing all while supporting a great cause. Other attractions within the area include the EMP museum, SAM sculpture park, Ambers (Top rated club in Seattle) as well as other bars and restaurants.

That doesn't mean there isn't a lot to do, right around the corner...Vito’s lounge and restaurant featuring cocktails and Italian fare - a great place for happy hour, is right across the street, the Frye Art Museum is just a short walk and complimentary to the public. some of our favorite best kept secrets are the boutiques at Melrose Market like Calf & Kid, Butter Home, Still Liquor, and Rain Shadow Meats. There's also the Broadway Farmers Market and Virginia Mason Farmers Markets to purchase fresh flowers, produce, honey, and handmade chocolate. Starbucks Reserve & Roastery and Stumptown are close by too.  \n",

      "Ames lake is an oasis close to town. The lake is usually quiet.  At night the bullfrogs are the loudest things around. Lots of migratory waterfowl in fall and winter including coots, ruddy ducks, mergansers, grebes, buffleheads, loons, occasional wood duck or ring necked duck.  Swallows, kingfishers, turtles and bald eagles are here all year. Beavers inhabit the south end of the lake. July-August are great for swimming with the lake warming up. More intrepid souls have been known to swim much later into the year. Great hiking and mountain biking trails within walking distance. Close to skiing in winter.  But the best part is you are still only 15 minutes from civilization. The locals love it here and definitely consider themselves lucky to be privy to this piece of nature's beauty. The community is close knit and people around are helpful.\n",

Commonly residents take time out of their busy schedules to enjoy a walk around the lake with a friend. If they are in more of a hurry or need to get a good sweat on they can be see running, biking, rollerblading or playing ball in one of the many grassy areas. On a hot day the park fills with people enjoying the sun. Pick-nicks, Volleyball games and floating lake gatherings are very popular on a hot weekend day. In our opinion it is the best place to be in Seattle. \n",

Small park next door to relax in or take Fido for a dog break, Little Lago just down Fuhrman Ave for some groceries, coffee, lunch, dinner, etc. Along Eastlake there's Le Fournil for your coffee/french bakery fix and a bit further down (still walkable) Eastlake Bar & Grill, Sushi Kappo Tamura, Little Water Cantina, Mammoth sandwiches, Otter Bar, Pomodoro, Pecado Bueno, Starbuck's, Voxx Coffee and on and on. That's only in one direction! Cross the University Bridge north over the water and explore all of the University of Washington campus within a 5-10 minute walk!\n",

Generally, these people are non-threatening and keep to themselves, but I can 100% guarantee that you will see evidence of homelessness (tents on sidewalks, in medians, in parks, underneath overpasses - pretty much everywhere), no matter where you stay. If seeing this will cause you anxiety so severe that you would not be able to enjoy the city at all, you may want to reconsider the timing of your trip. Complaints related to the city-wide homeless epidemic are not entitled to refund.\n",

      "Named one of the American Planning Association’s 30 Great Places in America, North Beacon Hill is one of Seattle’s most exciting up-and-coming neighborhoods, offering residents and visitors proximity to diverse, international cuisine and quick access to downtown. The streets are lined with a combination of beautiful older homes; recently-built, modern townhomes; and a growing number of trendy eateries and pubs. Our neighborhood is proud of its reputation for  efforts at sustainable living, which include urban gardens and a commitment to a bike-and-pedestrian-friendly community and infrastructure. We enjoy living in a neighborhood with a walk score of 76, where dining and entertainment are often within walking distance. Just ask, and we’re more than happy to share recommendations and local gems! \n",

      "It's beautiful here.  Fresh air, trees, gardens. Friendly, liberal, folks in a bedroom community to the University of Washington.  Whole Foods and PCC are grocery stores with organic produce within walking distance.  So close to Greenlake - a three mile walk or ride or roller skate or jog around the lake is a must do for \"people watching\".  Just south of here is Cowen Park which is a beautiful old growth forest in a deep ravine, right in the middle of the city.  Ravines are typical here in hilly Seattle.   We are very close to the University District with reasonably priced restaurants, book stores, coffee shops, and the farmers market on Saturday's.\n",

This area is known for its focus on sustainability and health, and as such is a very diverse and interesting environment. You can access Columbia City and Georgetown easily. The new Columbia City PCC Natural Market, with its huge range of organic, fresh and healthy foods, is just a short drive or a 15-minute walk away. I am happy to direct you to the city's best cannabis stores and culinary experiences, to give you a real local perspective. I have plenty of space for parking. There is a park just a couple minutes’ walk away with tennis courts and a large playing field. I know you’ll find this area of Seattle has so much to offer, as well as access to the abundance of the City via the Seattle Light rail. My home and neighborhood are both very warm and welcoming, and I look forward to seeing you!\n",

Considered the most hip and trendy of the Seattle’s young culture, this district is centrally located with easy access to the whole city. Check out the “all are welcome” attitude at some of Pike and Pine St’s classic bars that make our beloved city so wonderful. Bop in the other direction to the infamous Broadway Ave and see what all of the fuss is about. We work in the beer/liquor industry, so upon your booking we’ll give you our recommendations for some of our favorite local spots. Feel free to help yourself to any beer in the fridge, but please be respectful when it comes to our liquor/spirits bar\n",
